microbit-rc-controllerThis extension turns a BBC micro:bit into a proportional RC transmitter for drone, rover, or robot control using the built-in radio module.The controller sends a comma-separated string of four channels: Throttle, Roll, Pitch, Yaw where all values range from 0 to 1023.The expected format sent is: "THR,AIL,ELE,RUD"UsageController Functions:ChannelInput MethodControl Range (0-1023)Roll (AIL)Accelerometer X-axis tilt (Left/Right)0 (Full Left) to 1023 (Full Right)Pitch (ELE)Accelerometer Y-axis tilt (Forward/Backward)0 (Full Forward) to 1023 (Full Backward)Throttle (THR)Button B (increase), Button A (decrease)0 (Min) to 1023 (Max)Yaw (RUD)Fixed CenterFixed at 512 (Neutral)Reset/FailsafeButton A + BSets Throttle to 0 and Yaw to 512.Block:Use the single custom block in your on start program:microbitRC.startController(1)
Note: The receiver micro:bit (connected to the drone's flight controller) must be set to the same radio group and must be running custom MicroPython code to parse the radio string and convert the 0-1023 values into the 1000-2000 Î¼s serial protocol required by the flight controller.LicenseMIT
